## Governed repos

| Repo | Local path | Governance since | Maturity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HopSkipInc/ai-fleet | `~/repos/HopSkipInc/ai-fleet` | 2026-05 | High — 8+ audit cycles, governance-health live | Primary reference implementation; source for most template improvements |
| HopSkipInc/analytics-infrastructure | `~/repos/HopSkipInc/analytics-infrastructure` | 2026-06 | Early — inaugural audit done, code-hygiene not yet wired | Recent adopter; surface onboarding friction as a template signal |
| HopSkipInc/enrichment-pipeline | `~/repos/HopSkipInc/enrichment-pipeline` | 2026-06 | Early-mid — first audit cycle done | Code-hygiene / slop-detection most complete here; reference for that artifact class |
