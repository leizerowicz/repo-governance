/**
 * lint:adr-readme-sync  [governance template — copy to host/scripts/ in the target repo]
 *
 * Every decision record must be registered in its directory's README index.
 * Covers both record types:
 *   docs/adr/NNN-*.md  must have a row in docs/adr/README.md   (architecture decisions)
 *   docs/pdr/NNN-*.md  must have a row in docs/pdr/README.md   (product decisions)
 *
 * An unregistered record allows the next contributor to reuse the same number —
 * a numbering collision that causes confusion and audit gaps.
 *
 * Check: the README contains "(NNN-filename.md)" for every NNN-*.md file in the same
 * directory. The parenthesised filename is the markdown link target, which is unique
 * and unambiguous regardless of what text appears elsewhere in the README.
 *
 * Each directory is checked independently and is optional — a repo with no docs/pdr/
 * is silently fine. This is what makes the lint safe to ship everywhere, and why a
 * repo that later adopts PDRs gets the gate with no wiring change.
 *
 * GATE: exits non-zero on any unregistered record.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE NAME: this file is still called check-adr-readme-sync.mjs and is still
 * wired as `lint:adr-readme-sync` even though it now covers PDRs too. Renaming it
 * would break the wiring in every repo that already runs it, for cosmetics. If you
 * are adopting this fresh and want a record-neutral name, rename both the file and
 * the npm script together.
 *
 * Wiring (ai-fleet pattern):
 *   package.json:  "lint:adr-readme-sync": "node scripts/check-adr-readme-sync.mjs"
 *   check script:  && npm run lint:adr-readme-sync --prefix $ROOT/host
 *   CI (run-tests.yml):
 *     - name: ADR README sync check
 *       run: node scripts/check-adr-readme-sync.mjs
 *       working-directory: host
 *
 * For repos without an npm check script (e.g. analytics-infrastructure):
 *   Name this file lint-adr-readme-sync.mjs and add a job to ci.yml.
 *   See analytics-infrastructure/scripts/lint-adr-readme-sync.mjs for the
 *   standalone variant.
