# ADR-NNN: <Title>

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNN | Retired
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Context

What problem this decision solves. Written so a stranger could read it and understand
why this was a decision, not a default.

State what was happening before, what failure mode it produced, and what alternatives
were considered. Where the decision was driven by a specific incident, cite it. Where
the decision was discovered by probing the codebase rather than made deliberatively,
say so — "the codebase has done this consistently since the first commit" is valid
context, and noting it as discovered vs. decided is the difference between an ADR and
a retroactive justification.

## Decision

What is decided. One sentence, specific enough to be violated.

"We use a repository layer for all database access" can be violated. "We follow good
engineering practices" cannot. If you cannot state what would violate this decision,
it is not a decision — it is a platitude.

## Enforcement

What lint, check, or CI gate enforces this decision. An ADR cannot move to **Accepted**
without enforcement wired and passing. This is the architecture-layer form of the DoD's
core rule: enforcement ships with the promise, not after it.

If the enforcement is genuinely expensive to build now, the ADR stays **Proposed** with
a tracking issue, and the audit holds the gap.

- **Lint/check:** <script name or CI step, or "not yet built — tracking issue #N">
- **Wired into:** <npm run check / CI workflow name / pre-commit hook>

## Consequences

What this commits us to. What it forecloses. What work it authorizes — and what work it
makes off-limits without superseding this record first.

## What an ADR is

An ADR records a decision about how the code is shaped — architectural patterns,
conventions, and invariants that would be expensive to break. A PDR records a decision
about why the software exists at all.

The test: an ADR is falsified by engineering reality. A PDR is falsified by market
reality. "All DB access goes through the repository layer" is an ADR. "We serve solo
operators, not agencies" is a PDR. If you cannot say what external event would make the
decision wrong, it is probably an ADR.

## The rule

**An ADR without enforcement is a suggestion. Every ADR ships with the lint, check, or
CI gate that enforces it.**

This is the architecture-layer form of the DoD's core rule — enforcement ships with the
promise. A PDR without a falsifier is a wish; an ADR without a lint is a hope.

An ADR with no enforcement can never be violated loudly. It can only be violated
silently, which is the exact failure mode the ADR exists to prevent.

## Enforcement discipline

The enforcement must be **deterministic** — a script that exits 0 or non-zero, not a
judgment call. "The reviewer checks that X" is not enforcement; it is optimism about
reviewers. "The CI fails if X" is enforcement.

Good:
- `scripts/check-repository-pattern.mjs` — fails if any source file imports a DB driver
  directly instead of going through `src/repositories/`
- CI gate on migration naming — fails if a migration file doesn't match `NNN_*.sql`
- `npm run lint` includes a custom rule that rejects inline SQL in route handlers

Not good:
- "Code review ensures X" — reviewers are not deterministic
- "We agreed to X" — agreements rot the moment someone is under pressure
- "The README says X" — documentation is not enforcement

If you cannot write a lint for it, the ADR stays Proposed with a tracking issue. The
audit will flag it every cycle until the lint ships or the ADR is superseded.

## Discovered vs. decided

Many ADRs are discovered by probing the codebase, not made deliberatively. "Every file
in src/services/ exports a register() function" might be a deliberate pattern or might
be how the first engineer happened to do it and everyone else copied. Both are valid
ADRs — the codebase enforces the convention whether or not anyone decided it.

When writing a discovered ADR, note in Context that it was discovered, not decided. The
interview's job is to confirm the pattern is intentional (or at least load-bearing enough
to enforce). If it's accidental and not load-bearing, it's not an ADR — it's just how
the code happened to be written, and codifying it adds friction without value.

## Changing your mind

Never edit a Decision in place. Write a new ADR that supersedes the old one, set the old
one's Status to `Superseded by ADR-NNN`, and leave its Context intact. The record of
what you believed and why you changed it is the most valuable thing in the corpus.

A superseded ADR is not an embarrassment; it is evidence the mechanism works.
