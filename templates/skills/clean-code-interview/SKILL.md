# Clean Code Interview

Capture how code should be written in this repo — naming, organization, structure, and
quality conventions — as ADRs with enforcement, or as convention notes where enforcement
isn't warranted.

**This skill probes a different layer than `adr-interview`.** ADRs capture architectural
decisions (how the system is shaped): repository pattern, append-only migrations, all DB
access through a data layer. Clean code conventions capture how the *code itself* is
written: naming, file placement, dead code policy, complexity thresholds, import
ordering. The line is real: "all DB access goes through repositories" is an ADR; "repository
files are named `<Entity>Repository.ts` and live in `src/repositories/`" is a clean code
convention.

**The triage question is the whole design.** Architecture decisions are either
load-bearing or not — the interview confirms. Clean code conventions have a third option:
**intentional but not load-bearing.** "We use camelCase for variables" is intentional, but
a contractor violating it won't cause a bug — the formatter catches it, or it doesn't
matter. The interview's job is to sort every convention into three buckets:

1. **Enforce** — load-bearing enough that a violation could cause a bug or waste work. Gets an ADR + lint.
2. **Document** — intentional but not bug-causing. Gets a convention note, not an ADR.
3. **Drop** — accidental, not load-bearing. Gets nothing. Stop codifying how the first engineer happened to type.

**An ADR without enforcement is a suggestion.** Same rule as adr-interview: every
convention promoted to an ADR ships with its lint in the same PR. The difference is that
clean code conventions often have off-the-shelf enforcement (eslint, ruff, prettier) —
the work is configuration, not writing a custom lint.

**Usage:**
- `/clean-code-interview` — bootstrap conventions from scratch
- `/clean-code-interview refresh` — re-audit conventions against current codebase state

---

## Step 0: Discover the repo

Do all of these in parallel:

1. **Check for existing convention docs.** `docs/conventions.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md`, `docs/style-guide.md`. Read whatever exists.

2. **Read existing ADRs.** They may already encode some conventions. Don't duplicate — if ADR-005 says "all API responses follow the envelope shape in `src/types/api.ts`", that's already covered.

3. **Read lint/formatter configs.** These are the repo's *enforced* conventions:
   - JS/TS: `.eslintrc.*`, `.prettierrc*`, `biome.json`, `deno.json`
   - Python: `pyproject.toml` ([tool.ruff], [tool.black], [tool.mypy]), `.flake8`, `setup.cfg`
   - Go: `.golangci.yml`, `gofumpt` config
   - Rust: `clippy.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`
   - C#: `.editorconfig`, `Directory.Build.props`, `dotnet-format` config
   - All languages: `.editorconfig`

4. **Read CI config.** `.github/workflows/` — what lint/format gates are wired? Are they required checks or advisory?

5. **Read the DoD.** `docs/definition-of-done.md` — its Feature section may already have code quality rules.

6. **List the source tree** top-level and one level deep. Note:
   - File naming patterns (kebab-case, snake_case, PascalCase?)
   - Directory organization (feature-based? layer-based? hybrid?)
   - Test file placement (alongside source? separate test/ dir? __tests__/?)

7. **Pull recent merged PRs** — they reveal whether conventions are followed in practice:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number,title,mergedAt | \
     jq -r '.[] | "\(.mergedAt[0:10]) #\(.number) \(.title)"'
   ```

## Step 1: Spawn the evidence agent

Send with `run_in_background: true`. Do not poll — you'll be notified.

```
Read this codebase and inventory its code quality conventions — naming, file
organization, structural patterns, and quality invariants. You are building the evidence
base for triaging which conventions are load-bearing enough to enforce, which are
intentional but cosmetic, and which are accidental patterns that shouldn't be codified.

Repo root: {PWD}

## What to read
- docs/conventions.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/coding-standards.md, docs/style-guide.md (if they exist)
- ALL existing ADRs (they may encode conventions already)
- Lint/formatter configs: .eslintrc, .prettierrc, pyproject.toml [tool.ruff], .golangci.yml, .editorconfig, etc.
- CI workflows: .github/workflows/ — what lint/format gates are wired?
- docs/definition-of-done.md if it exists
- The source tree: top-level dirs, one level deep in each major dir
- 10-20 source files sampled across modules (not just one area)
- Last 30 merged PRs (gh pr list --state merged --limit 30)
- Any existing custom lint scripts in scripts/ or tools/

## What to produce

### 1. Naming conventions (max 6 candidates)
For each, state:
- The convention (e.g., "test files are named `<name>.test.ts` alongside the source file")
- Whether it's consistent across the codebase, or where it breaks
- Whether a formatter/linter already enforces it (cite the rule)
- Whether it's likely intentional or accidental (e.g., camelCase in JS is language
  default — probably accidental; a specific test naming pattern is probably intentional)

### 2. File organization conventions (max 4 candidates)
- Where do specific file types live? (handlers, models, services, utils, tests)
- Is the directory structure feature-based, layer-based, or hybrid?
- Are there conventions about what goes in which directory?
- Is any directory consistently misused (files that don't match the directory's purpose)?

### 3. Quality invariants (max 6 candidates)
Patterns that prevent bugs if followed, cause bugs if violated:
- Error handling patterns (try/catch shape, error propagation, error types)
- Import/export conventions (barrel files? no circular deps? explicit re-exports?)
- Dead code policy (are unused exports removed? is there a tool that checks?)
- Complexity patterns (max function length, max nesting depth — enforced or not?)
- Duplication patterns (is duplicated code flagged? is there a threshold?)
- Dependency boundaries (can modules import across feature boundaries? is it enforced?)

For each: is it followed consistently? is it enforced? what happens when violated?

### 4. Lints without documentation
List every lint/formatter rule that enforces a convention not documented anywhere. Each
one is a convention the team already invested in enforcing — the record just needs to
catch up. These are the highest-confidence candidates.

### 5. CONTRADICTIONS
Where does the codebase disagree with itself?
- Module A uses one error handling pattern; module B uses another
- The lint config enforces X but 15 files have `// eslint-disable` or equivalent
- CONTRIBUTING.md says "name files X" but the codebase uses Y
- The formatter enforces 2-space indent but half the files use 4-space (pre-formatter code?)

For each: state both sides, cite both. DO NOT resolve — these become interview questions.

### 6. What's likely accidental
Patterns that are consistent but probably not deliberate:
- Language defaults (camelCase in JS, snake_case in Python)
- Framework conventions (Next.js page routing, Rails MVC layout)
- Patterns that exist because the first engineer used them and everyone copied

These need human triage: "is this a standard we should enforce, or just how it was written?"

Write ONLY to /tmp/clean-code-evidence.md. No other files.
```

---

## Step 2: Wait, then interview

Read `/tmp/clean-code-evidence.md`.

**Interview discipline:**

- **Use `AskUserQuestion`. One question at a time.**
- **Lead with the evidence.** Never "what are your code conventions?" — always *"your test files are named `<name>.test.ts` in src/ but `<name>_test.py` in scripts/ — is the TypeScript pattern the standard?"*
- **Open with contradictions.** They're the highest-yield and establish you read the code.
- **The triage question is the key question for every candidate:**
  *"Your codebase consistently does X. Is this:*
  *a) A standard we should enforce (violation could cause a bug or waste work)*
  *b) Intentional but cosmetic (we prefer it, but a violation isn't dangerous)*
  *c) Just how it was written (not a standard, don't codify it)"*
- **For lints without documentation:** *"You have an eslint rule enforcing X but no documentation of why. What drove this — was there an incident, or did someone just turn on the recommended ruleset?"*
- **Push on enforcement for "enforce" candidates:** *"Can we wire a lint for this, or does it need a custom check?"* Many clean code conventions have off-the-shelf enforcement — the work is config, not writing a script.
- **Don't over-promote to ADRs.** A convention that's "intentional but cosmetic" gets a note in CLAUDE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md, not an ADR. ADRs are for load-bearing decisions. The interview's job is to sort, not to maximize ADR count.

**For each "enforce" candidate, get:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Convention** | one sentence, specific enough to be violated |
| **Context** | what failure mode it prevents, or "discovered, team confirms it's intentional" |
| **Enforcement** | the lint rule/check that enforces it (existing or to be wired) |
| **Status** | Accepted (enforcement wired) or Proposed (enforcement pending) |

**For "document" candidates, get:**
- One sentence for a convention note (CLAUDE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md)
- No enforcement needed — these are preferences, not rules

---

## Step 3: Write the output

The output has three parts:

### ADRs (for "enforce" candidates)

Write `docs/adr/NNN-<slug>.md` following `templates/adr/_template.md`. These are coding-standard ADRs — same format, same enforcement requirement.

- **Status:** `Accepted` only if the lint is wired and passing. Otherwise `Proposed` with a tracking issue.
- **Enforcement:** cite the specific lint rule (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`), formatter config, or custom check script.
- **Register in `docs/adr/README.md`** and verify with `check-adr-readme-sync.mjs`.

### Convention notes (for "document" candidates)

Add to `CLAUDE.md` under a `## Code Conventions` section, or to `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```markdown
## Code Conventions

- Test files are named `<name>.test.ts` and live alongside the source file
- Use named exports, not default exports
- Error responses follow the envelope shape in `src/types/api.ts`
```

These are preferences, not rules — no enforcement, no ADR, no audit finding if violated.

### Lint configuration (for unenforced "enforce" candidates)

Wire the lint in the same PR if possible:
- Configure the rule in the existing linter config (eslint, ruff, golangci-lint, etc.)
- Add to the CI gate if not already wired
- If the lint is custom, write the script in `scripts/` and wire it into `npm run check` (or equivalent)

If wiring is too complex for this PR, file a tracking issue and leave the ADR as Proposed.

---

## Step 4: Branch, commit, open PR

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
BRANCH="clean-code/${DATE}"

git fetch origin
BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's|.*/||')
git worktree add ../clean-code-${DATE} -b "${BRANCH}" "origin/${BASE}"

cd ../clean-code-${DATE}
cp <written ADRs, convention notes, lint configs> <appropriate locations>

git add docs/adr/ CLAUDE.md CONTRIBUTING.md .eslintrc* pyproject.toml scripts/ .github/workflows/
git commit -m "docs: code quality conventions (${DATE})

Load-bearing conventions promoted to ADRs with enforcement. Cosmetic
conventions documented in CLAUDE.md. Confirmed by <name> on ${DATE}."
git push -u origin "${BRANCH}"

REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
gh pr create --repo "${REPO}" --base "${BASE}" \
  --title "docs: code quality conventions (${DATE})" \
  --body "..."
```

PR body must include:
- Each ADR with its convention, enforcement, and status
- Convention notes added to CLAUDE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md (list them)
- Lints wired in this PR (list rules added/configured)
- Anything left Proposed and what enforcement it's waiting on
- Contradictions the interview resolved

---

## Step 5: Present

1. Print each ADR: number, title, convention, enforcement, status.
2. Print convention notes added to CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md.
3. **Report the "drop" decisions** — patterns the human said are accidental and not worth codifying. This is valuable context: the next audit won't flag these as missing ADRs.
4. **Report unresolved contradictions.** A codebase with inconsistent conventions across modules has a problem that conventions alone don't fix.
5. Ask: *"What code quality issue has bitten you more than once?"* — that's a convention that should be an ADR with a lint.

---

## Tips

- **Not every pattern is a convention.** The most important skill is distinguishing intentional conventions from accidental patterns. "Every file has a default export" might be a team standard or might be because the first engineer used default exports and everyone copied. Ask.
- **Off-the-shelf enforcement is the fast path.** Most clean code conventions (naming, import ordering, no-unused-vars, complexity thresholds) have existing linter rules. The work is configuration + documentation, not writing custom scripts. Check eslint, ruff, golangci-lint rule sets before proposing a custom lint.
- **Don't over-promote.** A repo with 20 ADRs about code style is a repo where nobody reads ADRs. Reserve ADRs for conventions where violation causes bugs or wastes work. Everything else is a convention note.
- **The formatter is your best friend.** If a convention is purely cosmetic (indentation, semicolons, quote style), the formatter handles it. Don't write an ADR for what prettier already enforces — the formatter IS the enforcement, and it doesn't need a record.
- **Contradictions often reveal stale conventions.** "Module A uses the old pattern, module B uses the new pattern" usually means the convention changed and nobody wrote the superseding ADR. The interview should surface this, and the fix is a new ADR + a tracking issue to migrate module A.
