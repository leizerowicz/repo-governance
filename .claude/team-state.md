# repo-governance — Team State

Last updated: 2026-07-18 (session 12)

## Architecture & Key Decisions

- **ICP decision (2026-05-20):** Beachhead is non-technical founders — people who "get it" but don't have the technical chops to "do it." Not corporate CTOs, not VPEs. Jeff Bruno / BModelr is the prototype.
- **Vocabulary shift:** Away from DORA, ADR coherence, governance debt (CTO vocabulary). Toward: contractor, build window, launch date, spec drift, "system holds without you" (founder vocabulary).
- **Value prop reframe:** "Technical judgment for the duration of your build" — governance is the mechanism, not the product.
- **One-pager:** Old CTO-ICP version archived as `gtm/one-pager-cto-icp.md`. New founder-ICP version is `gtm/one-pager.md`.

## Conventions

- GTM artifacts live in `gtm/`. Archive old versions with an ICP or context suffix rather than deleting.
- Positioning working notes in `gtm/positioning.md` — living doc, not finished collateral.

## Current Sprint Focus

Session 5 additions (2026-06-15):
- **`/review-sync` run complete:** 36/36 proposals accepted from the 2026-06-10 ai-fleet sync. All 7 template files cleaned. Three new templates promoted: `issue-authoring.md`, `governance-health.md`, `audit-deadman.yml`. PR template and DoD substantially expanded.
- **Maintenance prompts generated:** first batch in `downstream/hopskip/` for all three repos. enrichment-pipeline already applied theirs. ai-fleet and analytics-infrastructure pending.
- **Tracking process added to `/review-sync`:** Step 5 now has three sub-steps — 5.0 pre-flight (grep downstream repos for prior prompt outcomes, update log), 5.1 generate prompts (every prompt requires `## Verifiable outcomes` shell checks), 5.2 update `_client.md` maintenance log.
- **`_client.md` maintenance log:** tracks all prompts with `pending | applied YYYY-MM-DD | partial` status. Local repo paths added to governed-repos table.

**2026-06-15 maintenance prompts — all applied:**
- enrichment-pipeline: applied 2026-06-15
- analytics-infrastructure: applied 2026-06-15 (5/5 outcomes verified)
- ai-fleet: applied 2026-06-15 (3/4 checks pass; 4th was false positive — `docs/*` glob exists but `!docs/audits/` exception already present from PR #684; review-sync skill updated with `.gitignore` outcome check guidance)

Session 6 additions (2026-06-15):
- **DB migration governance standard added:** `templates/db-migration-governance.md` — DbUp mandatory for all governed repos with a database (Postgres: `dbup-postgresql`, SQL Server: `dbup-sqlserver`). Squash triggers: (b) >50 non-baseline increments OR (c) major schema milestone. Archive replaced files to `scripts/migrations/archive/YYYYMMDD-squash/`. CI harness required as a PR gate (required status check, not advisory).
- **Two new workflow templates:** `templates/workflows/db-migration-harness-postgres.yml` and `templates/workflows/db-migration-harness-sqlserver.yml` — Postgres variant uses `--spawn-container`; SQL Server variant uses GHA service container (`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest`).
- **Three new maintenance prompts generated:**
  - enrichment-pipeline: squash 62 files → baseline, wire harness as required PR gate
  - ai-fleet: DbUp adoption — remove dead namespaces (archive, captains-log confirmed dead), create DbUp project, journal bootstrap from `schema_migrations` → `schemaversions`, new PR gate
  - analytics-infrastructure: DbUp for SQL Server — 600+ idempotent scripts become day-0 baseline, no journal bootstrap needed (IF OBJECT_ID guards make re-application safe), replace go-sqlcmd loop in `schema.yml` deploy step
- **Audit gap noted:** Governance audit should check for dead migration namespaces (dirs not referenced by any active runner). ai-fleet's archive/ and captains-log/ were dead but audit missed them. Audit checklist in `templates/db-migration-governance.md` now includes this check.

**DB migration work status:**
- enrichment-pipeline: [2026-06-15-db-squash.md](../downstream/hopskip/enrichment-pipeline/2026-06-15-db-squash.md) — **applied 2026-06-15** (#408)
- ai-fleet: [2026-06-15-db-dbup-migration.md](../downstream/hopskip/ai-fleet/2026-06-15-db-dbup-migration.md) — **applied 2026-07-06**
- analytics-infrastructure: [2026-06-15-db-dbup-migration.md](../downstream/hopskip/analytics-infrastructure/2026-06-15-db-dbup-migration.md) — **applied 2026-07-05** (#155)

Session 8 additions (2026-07-05):

- **`templates/competitive-intel.md`:** New template codifying the competitive-intel watch-list format and Future items convention, propagated from ai-fleet migration 0291 (`8c84a12` — feat: surface competitive-intel watch items as Future items in scheduled audit).
- **DoD Future items section added** to `templates/definition-of-done.md` Audit section — matches ai-fleet's addition to their DoD in the same commit.
- **Watch-list sweep domain** added as domain 5 in `templates/workflows/scheduled-audit.yml` — scans `docs/competitive-intel/*.md` for unchecked watch-list lines, renders Future items section in audit reports, escalates due items to P2.
- **PR template updated** — Documentation checklist now requires watch-list lines in competitive intel docs to have specific revisit conditions.
- **Two new downstream prompts generated** (2026-07-05-competitive-intel-watch.md) for analytics-infrastructure and enrichment-pipeline — each creates the competitive-intel directory, updates DoD, and wires the sweep into their respective audit machines (audit-data-platform, audit-enrichment-pipeline) via ai-fleet migration.

Session 10 additions (2026-07-07):

- **`templates/skills/competitive-analysis/SKILL.md`:** Self-discovering competitive analysis skill. Instead of baking in repo-specific ADR lists, primitive names, and source paths, the skill teaches Agent B to *discover* the architecture at runtime: find the ADR directory, read all ADRs, read architecture docs, list the source tree, and synthesize primitives from what it finds. Agent A researches the external product in parallel. Synthesis produces a gap analysis with decision (integrate / steal ideas / watch / reject). Output lands in `docs/watch-items/`. This replaces the earlier `.claude/commands/` approach — skills are portable across harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, fleet workers) since they're plain markdown workflows, not CLI-specific slash commands.
- **Single generic downstream prompt:** [2026-07-07-competitive-analysis-skill.md](../downstream/hopskip/2026-07-07-competitive-analysis-skill.md) — identical for all three governed repos. No per-repo customization. The skill discovers each repo's architecture at runtime.
- **Reverted the repo-specific prompts** (analytics-infrastructure/2026-07-07-competitive-analysis-command.md and enrichment-pipeline/2026-07-07-competitive-analysis-command.md) — they encoded too much repo-specific knowledge (exact ADR filenames, source paths, primitive names) which doesn't scale to real clients.
- **`templates/governance-sync-claude-section.md`:** A small CLAUDE.md section that tells downstream repo agents where repo-governance lives, what client name to use, and the convention for finding/applying/marking-done prompts. Without this breadcrumb, agents fly blind trying to "update from repo-governance."
- **Single downstream prompt:** [2026-07-07-governance-sync-claude-section.md](../downstream/hopskip/2026-07-07-governance-sync-claude-section.md) — identical for all three repos. Each repo fills in its own slug. The section is intentionally tiny (~12 lines) — just enough for an agent to self-navigate.
- **Key design principle:** repo-governance should teach *patterns and discovery methods*, not maintain a shadow mirror of each client's file tree. Skills that say "read all ADRs, read the architecture docs, discover the primitives" scale infinitely — skills that list `adr/0017-enrichment-prioritization.md` don't survive the next ADR write.
- **Bug discovered (2026-07-07):** The governance-sync CLAUDE.md section told downstream agents to update `_client.md` in repo-governance (step 5). This is wrong — cross-repo writes create race conditions and violate the trust boundary. Downstream repos should never modify repo-governance files.
- **Fix:** [2026-07-07-fix-governance-sync-ownership.md](../downstream/hopskip/2026-07-07-fix-governance-sync-ownership.md) — downstream agents now record applied prompts in their own CLAUDE.md under `### Applied governance updates`. repo-governance reconciles from there during `/review-sync`. Step 5 now explicitly warns "do not modify files in repo-governance."
- **Reconciliation design:** `/review-sync` reads each downstream repo's `### Applied governance updates` section and updates `_client.md`. Downstream repos are read-only sources; repo-governance owns the ledger.

Session 7 additions (2026-06-18):
- **lint:adr-readme-sync:** New governance lint. Every docs/adr/NNN-*.md must appear in docs/adr/README.md as a markdown link `(NNN-filename.md)`. Hard fail on any unregistered file. Catches ADR numbering collisions at PR time. Template at `templates/scripts/check-adr-readme-sync.mjs`.
- **lint:universal-tool-doc-sync:** New ai-fleet-specific governance lint. Scans db/migrations/host/*.sql for `scope = 'all'` in executable SQL, extracts tool_ids via three patterns (WHERE clause, IN clause, INSERT VALUES), asserts each appears in docs/adding-an-agent.md. Hard fail on missing or unresolvable entries.
- **ai-fleet wiring:** Both lints added to `host/package.json` (lint:adr-readme-sync, lint:universal-tool-doc-sync), to the `check` script chain, and to `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`. Meta-lint passes at 28 scripts. Both lints pass clean on master.
- **ai-fleet doc fix:** Added `post_for_acknowledgement` to the universal tools list in docs/adding-an-agent.md (was missing since migration 0192, June 2026; caught by the new lint).
- **ai-fleet ADR fix:** Registered ADR-051 (In-Loop Context Compaction Policy) in docs/adr/README.md — was filed 2026-06-17 but not indexed; caught by the new lint on first run.
- **analytics-infrastructure wiring:** lint:adr-readme-sync added as `scripts/lint-adr-readme-sync.mjs` and as `adr-readme-sync` gate job in `.github/workflows/code-hygiene.yml`. Passes clean (14 ADRs all registered).
- **Propagation assessment:** enrichment-pipeline (no docs/adr/) and compliance (no docs/adr/) → lint:adr-readme-sync WONT-FIX; not applicable. lint:universal-tool-doc-sync is ai-fleet-specific; no other governed repo has the tools table with scope='all' semantics.

Session 9 additions (2026-07-06):
- **analytics-infrastructure reconciliation:** Verified all 4 downstream prompts applied. DbUp migration (#155) and ADR lint (#144) were already landed but our log showed `pending` — corrected to `applied 2026-07-05` and `applied 2026-07-03`. Watch-items sweep was still pending at check time; re-checked after user flag and found commit `b203235` landed same day with all 4 verifiable outcomes passing. `_client.md` fully reconciled: analytics-infrastructure has zero open governance prompts.

Session 11 additions (2026-07-16):

- **Product Decision Records (PDRs) — the fourth layer of why.** The repo governed three: why each rule exists (DoD callouts), why the code is shaped this way (ADRs), why the consultancy exists (`gtm/`, never synced). Nothing recorded why the *software* exists. The gap was structural, not an oversight: every audit domain compares one repo artifact to another, and purpose has no counterpart in the repo, so there was nothing to compare against. The audit could prove code drifted from docs; it could never prove the product drifted from its reason for existing.
- **Why it mattered for the ICP:** non-technical founders. The contractor holds the code, the founder holds the thesis. Governance covered everything the contractor holds and nothing the founder holds — the one asset the buyer personally owns was the one the system didn't protect. `gtm/one-pager.md` already sells "a record of what was built and why".
- **The load-bearing rule:** *a decision without a falsifier is a wish.* Every PDR ships with the observable condition that would retire it and cannot reach Accepted without one — the product-layer form of "enforcement ships with the promise". A PDR without a falsifier is a vision statement, and vision statements don't rot loudly.
- **Design decisions:** PDR corpus (not a standing doc) so it reuses numbering, index, supersession, and the ADR audit domain. Non-goals are records with their own numbers, not sections — highest-signal artifact, since the audit can check shipped work against a stated non-goal and can do that for nothing else at this layer. Traceability at feature/epic level only, with `Serves: none` always legitimate.
- **Sync firewall (the highest-stakes piece):** `/sync-from-repo` reads live client repos and abstracts into templates that ship to *other clients*. PDR content is a client's market thesis — frequently confidential, and identifying even anonymized, because a good PDR is specific enough to be wrong. **The shape syncs; the records never do.** Harder line than `gtm/`: that's propose-don't-apply, this is don't-propose. Same for `docs/watch-items/` bodies.
- **`/review-sync` must never generate a PDR bootstrap prompt.** A prompt is what an agent runs alone, and an agent alone will invent a thesis or write a mission statement. A fabricated PDR is worse than an empty directory — it gets cited in review as though someone believed it. Prompts may install the form, index, ADR-023, and the lint, then say "book the interview".
- **`pdr-interview` skill — a new skill shape.** Every other skill discovers by probing, which works because architecture is in the codebase. Purpose isn't. But blank-slate asking produces mush, so: probe first, draft candidates from cited evidence, surface the repo's self-contradictions, *then* ask. The contradictions are the interview — they're the one question a human can't answer with a platitude.
- **Doctrine inversion, recorded in `sync-from-repo` Step 4:** these templates were authored *before* the source repo had them, inverting the normal harvest flow. They ship as **candidates**; the 3-cycle clock starts at ai-fleet adoption. Until then treat them as *less* authoritative than harvested templates — they've never been stress-tested against a real incident.
- **Two bugs caught by running the templates instead of reading them.** (1) Following GETTING_STARTED literally turned CI red on day one — the lint registers every `NNN-*.md` and the blank form was named `000-template.md`. Renamed `_template.md`; underscore matches the existing `_client.md` convention. ADRs never hit this because `templates/adr/022-*` is a real record, not a form. (2) The audit swept the form as a record, reporting its placeholder falsifier as a real Future item every run. Same root cause both times: **a blank form in a records directory gets treated as a record.**
- **Also fixed (pre-existing, found en route):** `c627809` reframed competitive-intel → watch-items across all three repos but never touched the templates. A repo bootstrapped today got a skill writing to `docs/watch-items/` and a sweep globbing `docs/competitive-intel/` — the sweep matched nothing and reported nothing, which is indistinguishable from "all items on hold". `templates/competitive-intel.md` → `templates/watch-items.md`, rewritten generic. GETTING_STARTED also claimed the audit covered "four domains" (stale since session 8; now six).
- **README under-listing fixed:** `templates/` rows for db-migration-governance, watch-items, scripts, skills, and the harness workflows were missing from "What you get" — the leak `/review-sync` Step 3 exists to catch and wasn't catching.

**PDR status:** templates + lint + audit wiring landed on `chore/session-10-cleanup`. **Not propagated.** Next: run `/pdr-interview` in ai-fleet, file 3–5 records, let it run 3 audit cycles, then sync back and generate downstream prompts. Known weakness: ai-fleet is internal tooling, so its thesis is thin — it's a strong test of the machinery (lint, sweep, index) and a weak test of the interview. BModelr is the real test of the interview whenever it's reachable (founder was unreachable Jun 17–30; case study ~Aug 2026).

**Also open from session 10:** `/review-sync` still needs the reconciliation step that reads each downstream repo's `### Applied governance updates` section to update `_client.md` (replacing the old write-back pattern).

Session 12 additions (2026-07-18):

- **Targeted lint sync from ai-fleet (not a full `/sync-from-repo` run).** User asked to check out ai-fleet's recent new linting and generalize it — scoped to `host/scripts/*.mjs` additions since the 2026-07-05 sync commit (`b4cd58b`), not the full DoD/PR-template/audit/GTM sweep. Found 5 new lint scripts across 4 commits (`8fcdb40a`, `5e0ae636`, `cc724000`, `366d3f2b`).
- **Four propagated as new templates** (all `[PROPOSED]`-marked where they touch existing docs):
  - `templates/scripts/check-breaking-migrations.mjs` — ADR-008-style rule (number dropped per abstraction rules): a migration that drops/renames a column or table must have zero remaining code references, checked via diff-text replay of all migrations + source scan. Directly extends the existing `templates/db-migration-governance.md` (session 6). Source was driven by a real 2026-07-15 ai-fleet outage (schema drop landed same PR as one code fix; a second, unrelated file still queried the old column). Wired into `db-migration-governance.md` (new "Breaking-migration lint" section + audit checklist item) and `definition-of-done.md` Migration section.
  - `templates/scripts/check-magic-strings.mjs` and `check-inline-type-unions.mjs` — sibling TS-only lints: a value/type duplicating an exported alias without importing it. Genuinely portable (no ai-fleet business-schema coupling), scoped as "TypeScript repos" in README and DoD Feature section.
  - `templates/scripts/check-duplicated-sql.mjs` — TS-only, flags the same SQL query inlined in 2+ files instead of centralized in one registry/adapter.
  - All four generalized per Step 3 abstraction rules: `SRC_DIR`/`SOURCE_DIRS`/`MIGRATIONS_DIR` are now configurable constants at the top of each file (source hardcoded `host/src`, `host-tools` in ai-fleet), PRE_EXISTING_DUPLICATES / ALLOWLIST sets emptied as templates, ADR-008 rule number dropped.
- **Not propagated:** `check-credential-coverage.mjs` (from `8fcdb40a`) — verifies `capability_grants`/`credential_grants` coverage against ai-fleet's own agent/tool schema. WONT-FIX, same reasoning as session 7's `lint:universal-tool-doc-sync` — it's ai-fleet's business schema, not a general pattern.
- **Applicability note:** among governed repos, the three TS-hygiene lints currently apply cleanly only to ai-fleet (pure TS). enrichment-pipeline's `host/` is not TS (only its `frontend/` is), analytics-infrastructure is pure C#. `check-breaking-migrations.mjs` applies to any repo under the DbUp standard regardless of language, with a documented gap: SQL Server's `sp_rename`-based column rename isn't matched by the current regex (Postgres/ANSI `RENAME COLUMN` only).
- **Not yet done:** downstream maintenance prompts for governed repos (the `downstream/<client>/<repo>/` pattern from session 5/7). Didn't generate these since the ask was "generalize into the framework," not "roll out" — flag to user before generating, since ai-fleet itself would need one too (it has the *originals*, not the generalized/configured versions).
- **Committed and pushed to `sync/ai-fleet-lint-generalization-2026-07-18`** — not merged to master; [PROPOSED] markers still await review via `/review-sync` in a later session with fresh eyes.
- **Full-repo lint survey, all 3 governed repos (same session, continued):** user asked whether other lints across ai-fleet/analytics-infrastructure/enrichment-pipeline were poachable before committing to more work. Full inventory: ai-fleet has 34 `host/scripts/check-*.mjs` files (most are its own agent/tool/credential architecture — not portable); analytics-infrastructure has 6 Python lints under `scripts/` (all tied to its own concept-docs/event-bus/search-schema conventions — not portable) plus `lint-adr-readme-sync.mjs` and `lint-root-clutter.mjs`; enrichment-pipeline has `lint-root-clutter.mjs` and `lint-stub-tests.mjs` under `tools/`.
- **Key finding: `check-root-clutter.mjs`/`lint-root-clutter.mjs` exists independently in all 3 repos** — nobody copied it from anybody, three teams solved the same problem the same way. Strongest possible signal for "belongs in the templates." Now `templates/scripts/check-root-clutter.mjs`.
- **Propagated 3 more templates this session:**
  - `templates/scripts/check-root-clutter.mjs` — pure directory listing, zero language dependency, `ALLOWED` set is the only thing to configure.
  - `templates/scripts/check-schema-promises.mjs` (from ai-fleet's ADR-048 lint) — the sibling of `check-breaking-migrations.mjs`: enforcement-bearing schema element added by a migration must have a real consumer or a dormant-schema register entry. `definition-of-done.md`'s Migration section already stated this rule in prose; the mechanical lint was the missing piece. Wired as a new DoD checklist line.
  - `templates/scripts/lint-stub-tests.mjs` (from enrichment-pipeline) — flags npm `test`/`test:*` scripts that are `echo "not implemented" && exit 0` in disguise (false-green CI). Ships in **report mode** (WARN, not GATE) — the WARN→FAIL promotion convention. Wired into DoD's Feature section.
- **Tier 2 held for a follow-up session (not built):** `check-lint-ci-coverage.mjs` (ai-fleet meta-lint — every lint wired into both CI and the local check chain; npm-specific today, needs a non-npm equivalent) and `lint-sql-ddl.py` (analytics-infrastructure — mechanically enforces the idempotent-DDL discipline `db-migration-governance.md` already states as prose but has no lint backing; Python + SQL-Server-flavored today).
- **Open design question — flagged by user, not yet resolved:** every lint template shipped so far (8 scripts total now) is single-language: 4 are TypeScript-only, 1 is npm-only, 3 are language-agnostic by accident of implementation (root-clutter is a directory listing; breaking-migrations/schema-promises operate on `.sql` migration files plus a configurable multi-extension source scan). As governed repos diversify (analytics-infrastructure is pure C#, more clients will bring more stacks), **"copy this .mjs file" stops being a viable delivery mechanism** for anything that has to parse source code. Need to think through: (a) documenting each lint as a *concept* (the invariant + detection strategy) separately from its reference implementation, so a C#/Python port is a translation exercise instead of a rewrite from the incident; (b) whether repo-governance should ship reference implementations in more than one language for the highest-value lints (schema-promises and breaking-migrations are the best candidates — they already touch non-TS repos via the DbUp standard); (c) whether the abstraction-rule table in `.claude/commands/sync-from-repo.md` Step 3 needs a new row for "language-specific source-scanning lint → concept doc + per-language reference impl." No decision made — surfacing for a future session before the lint count grows much further.

## Conventions (additions)

- **Sync commits:** `sync: from <source-repo> <YYYY-MM-DD>` — `/sync-from-repo` Step 0 finds the last sync date by grepping for this.
- **Review commits:** `sync-review: <source-repo> <date> — accepted N/M proposals` — the N/M ratio calibrates the sync skill's abstraction rules.
- **Skill pair:** `/sync-from-repo` proposes (7 steps now: pre-flight the skill itself, templates, docs reconciliation, GTM proposals gated on user feedback); `/review-sync` dispositions in a later session with fresh eyes.
- ai-fleet's governance shape as of 2026-06: audits in `docs/audits/`, audit runs in-platform (cron machine) with `audit-deadman.yml` as the watchdog, `docs/issue-authoring.md` + 3-layer enforcement, governance-health live with 8+ cycles.
- **Multi-source governance (2026-06-14):** analytics-infrastructure and enrichment-pipeline now under governance. enrichment-pipeline has the most complete code-hygiene / slop-detection implementation (gate + report + WARN→FAIL). analytics-infrastructure is early-stage. Both are calibration sources in `/sync-from-repo`.
- **Downstream prompts:** `downstream/<client>/<repo>/YYYY-MM-DD-maintenance.md` — per-repo maintenance prompts generated by `/review-sync` Step 5. First batch to be generated in the next `/review-sync` session.
- **Kickoff prompt:** `downstream/_kickoff-prompt.md` — universal bootstrap for new repos; fill in context block and run in the target repo's Claude Code.

## Engagement Tracker

| Engagement | Client | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BModelr | Jeff Bruno | Active — pro-bono | Build window May 17–Jun 14 2026. Launch target Jun 17. Founder unreachable Jun 17–30 (Tokyo). Case study pending post-launch (~Aug 2026). |

## Partnership Tracker

| Partner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| JDAQA (Jay Aigner) | Not yet contacted | First meeting not booked. Referral reciprocity still makes sense despite ICP shift — Jay will encounter founders who can't execute his Assessment findings. Don't lead with BModelr doc. Lead with README + "regression drift" mechanism overlap. |

## Shared Gotchas

- DORA mapping section removed from founder-ICP one-pager — not the buyer's vocabulary.
- "Launch window coverage" engagement shape is new and not in the CTO one-pager — formalized from BModelr pattern.
